# Quiz
 A multiple-choice quiz using CSS, Javascript and jQuery.

 Using a Class for the questions, I was able to make an instance of the class for each question and randomly rearrange the order of the answers.

 I then created an array of all the questions which could be shuffled so that they appear in a random order.

 Using jQuery and CSS keyframes, when a user selects an answer, the correct answer will flash green.

 The scoreboard keeps track of the player's score and a message is displayed at the end of the quiz which differs depending on the score acheived.
